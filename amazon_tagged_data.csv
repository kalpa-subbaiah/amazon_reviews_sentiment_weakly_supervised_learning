1,"fashionable compression stockings!: after i had a dvt my doctor required me to wear compression stockings. i wore ugly white ted hose and yucky thick brown stockings. then i found jobst ultrasheer. they gave me the compression i needed (15-20,) but looked like regular pantyhose. even though my blood clot has been gone for 4 years, i still buy these to wear as support stockings because they make my legs feel so nice.**note, i have problems with the rubberized tops rolling down my thigh. i tried the jobst adhesive, but i hated having my skin pulled all day. i bought an inexpensive garter belt and it works fine and helps keep the stockings from rolling.", pulled ,inexpensive ,,,,"pulled,inexpensive",POSITIVE

0,"problem with charging smaller aaas: i have had the charger for more than two years. it charges aa batteries just fine, but has a huge problem securing smaller aaa batteries. to charge the smaller batteries you need to flip down the little button at the positive end. in the beginning one of the four aaa batteries would pop up, and now three out of the four won't hold. the problem is the flip mechanism became loose, and any horizontal pressure would push the buttons back up. what i have to do now is using duct tape and a segment of crayon, apply the crayon on the buttons, and wrap the tape around. you know how painful that is.",using,, smaller ,,,"using,smaller",NEGATIVE
